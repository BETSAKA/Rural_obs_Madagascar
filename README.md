# ROR

This technical appendix accompanies a scientific paper dedicated to the data from the Rural Observatory Network (ROR) collected between 1995 and 2015. It includes the source code for all figures and visualizations in the paper. It also offers a tutorial on how to georeference this data, which can serve as guidance for various types of analysis. We use computational notebooks in Quarto format with the R programming language, combining code, results, explanations, and multimedia in an interactive way.

The output of these computations can be accessed here: [https://betsaka.github.io/Rural_obs_Madagascar](https://betsaka.github.io/Rural_obs_Madagascar)
