## Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
```


## Survey description

The survey locations and conditions are stored in the `res_deb.dta`
files.

For instance, we describe the 2015 data:

```{r analyse_2015_desc}
# There is a village name in 2008
deb_2008 <- read_dta("enter/2008/res_deb.dta")


# There is no village name in 2015
deb_2015 <- read_dta("enter/2015/res_deb.dta")

```
